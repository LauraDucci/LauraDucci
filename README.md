### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , my name is Laura

I am currently finishing my final thesis for my Biomedical Engineering degree and
my first Full Stack development course. My goal is to continue improving with the tools I
have learned and, added to the skills obtained throughout my career, to generate efficient
solutions that contribute to my professional and personal development. I enjoy teamwork
and I always try to incorporate proactivity on my everyday tasks.

Skills: HTML / CSS / PHP / SQL / JavaScript / React / Bootstrap / Material-UI / Figma
